            <p>My website is themed around a playground. When the user steps into a playground, a feeling of joy, creativity and letting loose takes place.
                 As a researcher, I hope that this joy can be replicated through our research work and learn to inspire passion. Playgrounds also remind 
                 people of social interaction and collaboration, even connecting with the strangers within the compound. This breaking of barriers is something
                 I hope to do in my research, crushing boundaries between disciplines and knowledge to build new innovations. When we are passionate, we also 
                 put in our greatest effort, constantly creating innovations we are proud of. Lastly I am deeply passionate for artificial intelligence, and 
                 finding creative ways to improve peoples workflows.
